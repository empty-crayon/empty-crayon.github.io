title: My Impossible List

What compass steers the ship of your life after you have finished that degree and landed that job?
I have long wanted to jot down the things I want to do life. This impossible list is my way of doing just that.

Taking a cue from the brilliant [Thomas Frank](https://youtu.be/6apcEae2U4w), I created this Impossible List.

Here, I jot down the sane and insane things I want to do in life, because life's more than just that daily grind. How's it different from your regular old bucket list, you ask?

Well, a bucket list doesn't exactly give you a kick in the pants to get started right away. It's more of a vague collection of things you'd like to do sometime in the distant future. The Impossible List, on the other hand, is the real deal. It requires a plan and immediate action. Plus, it's an ever-evolving list! When I tick something off, you bet I'll replace it with something even more audacious.

This list is quite personal but I keep it here to keep myself accountable and motivate others to create one of their own!
